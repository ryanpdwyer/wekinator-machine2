# Notes

- Basic approach works great; we can take all of the teachable machine, tensorflow stuff and load it via the browser. The only node stuff happens via contextBridge, node-osc-wek package works fine for that.
- Anything else? Just lots of small tweaks, updating dependencies to make everything work right

`tfCore` is now just `tf`
`nPose` is `tmPose`
Any others?
